Many people have reported that they get "disabling ioctl methods - constant
not found". This is due to missing perl header files. Copy these files from
perlheader/asm to /usr/lib/perl/<perl version>/asm/. Your destination
may change but, this directory is top level directory of perl distribution.

If your modem fails to respond to AT# commands, then replace AT# with AT+ at
all places in Ivrs.pm.

For fax install efax or copy efix and efax from bin/ to your /usr/bin.

For converting your recorded wav files, install mgetty-voice for pvftools
support.

US Robotics support is added.
