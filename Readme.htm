IVRS is relatively new technology aimed to integrate computer and telephony.
We find number IVR system in daily walk of life giving various types information
to caller like tele banking, product information, fax servers, call centers,
and others. All these can be implemented using this module under linux.
Newer linux kernel had computer telephony support but that was restricted
to specific hard ware and not the ordinary modem. Vgetty, which is voice
version of getty,&nbsp; is around for many years, but I found Vgetty not
very suitable for IVRS due to slow responses, and lack of proper documentation.
This modules is based on&nbsp; perl and voice modem and does not require
any other special cards, not even sound card. I have tested it on Red Hat
6.1 and debian 2.1, but I see no reason why it should not work on other
Linux distribution. As regard capability of this module, it can play message
(up to 11025 byes/sec), get Caller ID, send /receive Fax, record Message,
dial out side number, generate fast response (no need to wait for message
to complete), interface with data base,&nbsp; and in short almost every
thing what a commercial IVRS can do. The only limitation which I fore see
compared to other IVRS using Dialogic card is the number of telephone line
that can be supported on one machine.&nbsp; I have tested this IVRS on
two modem and it rocks, which hopefully should hold good for 4 modem (with
extra serial port card) as well.

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#993366">-</FONT></B>&nbsp; The use of standard voice
modem (33.6kbps and above ) obviates the need for additional hardware for
IVRS. The modem has a micro controller and a data pump (analog to digital
to analogue converter). These two makes a beautiful voice /fax/ data interface
to telephone line which can play voice files up sampling rate of 11025
bytes/sec (most commercial card allow up to 7200 byts/sec only) . Beside
this you can divert your voice signal to / from&nbsp; internal speaker
and microphone, and add external speaker and microphone.&nbsp; The PC&nbsp;
communicates to Modem via serial port and AT commands. The complete AT
command set contains more than 100 commands and available on net. The new
voice modem has ability to read the CallerID information, receive/send
fax , dial another number, line quality diagnosis etc.&nbsp; Due to use
of modem , this IVRS is limited to two channel (or Telephone lines), because
PC has only two serial ports. Multi port serial card can be installed but
I have not tested it. In my opinion this not a limitations as one modem
can cater to almost 3000 user. I have seen other IVRS which uses Dialogic
Cards, these cards are nothing but the multiple modem (2, 4, 8, 16 ) on
ISA or PCI cards. As these card communicates with PC via ISA or PCI slot,&nbsp;
the data transfer speed is very high and hence PC can cater to multiple
modem (8 or 16) at a time.&nbsp; How ever cost of these card is prohibitive
and around Rs.35,000&nbsp; for a two channel card. (when last I checked).

There is lot of reading material for sound file on the net. I will restrict
this discussion to IVRS only. The modem understands only rmd (raw modem
data)&nbsp; files. The pvftools (Portable Voice Format Tools)&nbsp; which
is included with Vgetty has excellent utilities to convert files from one
format to another format. I have used two types of files ( in sfiles/ of
this package), one is raw modem data type which can be sent directly to
modem for playing and another is lin type. In any IVRS to play smoothly
messages ,numbers,&nbsp; the messages&nbsp; have to be created on the fly.
This is where another type of file called lin is use full. These are nothing
but the voice data files with no header or footer. You can cut and paste
these file to make a new file. This lin file is converted to raw modem
data type and then played to&nbsp; modem. The lin and rmd files can be
created from wave (mono) using pvftools, I have used and included some&nbsp;
pvftools with this distribution. The voice files with this distribution
are customized for Rockwell chip set modem, which is most popular. The
pvftools supports other modem type also also. I have tested&nbsp; Dlink,
GVC, LanBit and many other modem. The modem speed does not matter because
voice modem with 33.6 Kbps and above will work fine.

- This distribution is complete with all the voice files and to make a
full functional IVRS you need a few line of perl scripts and additional
message files. You may&nbsp; need to record messages,&nbsp; if you want
additional messages or you do not like the tone of these files,&nbsp; and
cut them in to separate file. These messages can be recorded in wav format
then converted to rmd or lin format. File convert utilities are also included
with distribution. You also need to write small scripts to fetch the numerical
data from files which is played to caller. The demo scripts included in
this distribution gives fair knowledge of module.
