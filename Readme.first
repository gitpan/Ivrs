               INTERACIVE VOICE RESPONSE SYSTEM

INTRODUCTION- IVRS (Interactive Voice Response System) is relatively new 
technology aimed to integrate computer and telephony. We find number of 
IVRS in daily walk of life giving various types of information to caller 
through Tele banking, Product Information, Fax Servers, Call Centers, Voice 
Mail Systems, and many more. All these can be implemented using this module 
under linux. Newer linux kernel has computer telephony support but it is 
restricted to specific hardware and does not support Voice modem. Vgetty, 
which is a voice version of getty, is around for many years, but I found 
Vgetty not suitable for IVRS due to it's slow responses, and lack of proper 
documentation. This modules is written in perl, uses voice modem and does 
not require any other special cards, not even the sound card. I have tested 
it on Red Hat 6.2 and debian 2.1, but I see no reason why, it should not 
work on other Linux distribution. As regard capability of this module, it 
can play message (sampling rate 11025 bytes/sec), get Caller ID, send /receive 
fax, Record message, dial out side number, generate fast response (no need 
to wait for message to complete), interface with data base, and in short 
almost every thing that a commercial IVRS can do. The only limitation which 
I fore see compared to other IVRS using Dialogic card is the number of 
telephone line that can be supported on one machine.  I have tested this 
IVRS on two modems and it rocks, which hopefully should hold good for 4 
modems (with extra serial port card) as well. 

MODEM - The use of standard voice modem (33.6kbps and above) obviates the 
need for additional hardware for IVRS. The modem has a micro controller and 
a data pump (analog to digital to analog converter). These two makes a 
beautiful voice /fax/ data interface to telephone line which can play voice 
files up to a sampling rate of 11025 bytes/sec (most commercial card allow 
up to 8000 bytes/sec only). Beside this you can divert voice signal to/from 
internal speaker and microphone, and add external speaker and microphone. 
The PC communicates with Modem via serial port and AT commands. The complete 
AT command set contains more than 100 commands and it is freely available 
on net. This module mostly uses the AT# commands. The new voice modem has 
ability to read the CallerID information, receive/send fax, dial another 
number, line quality diagnosis etc.  Due to use of modem, this IVRS is 
limited to two channel (or Telephone lines), because PC has only two serial 
ports. Multi port serial card can be installed but I have not tested it. In 
my opinion this not a limitations as single modem based IVRS can cater to 
almost 3000 callers. I have tested Dlink, GVC, and LanBit modems with this 
module. The modem speed does not matter because voice modem with 33.6 KBPS 
and above will work fine. I have seen other IVRS, which uses Dialogic Cards,
these cards are nothing but the multiple modems (2, 4, 8, 16) on ISA or PCI 
card. As these cards communicates with PC via ISA or PCI slot, the data 
transfer rate is very high and hence PC can cater to multiple modem at one 
time. However these card are expensive compared to modem. 

VOICE FILES - You will find lot of reading material for sound format on the 
net. I will restrict this discussion to IVRS only. The modem understands only 
rmd (raw modem data) format. The pvftools (Portable Voice Format Tools) which 
is included with Vgetty has excellent utilities to convert sound files from 
one format to another format. From version 0.6, I have used raw modem data 
type (or rmd ) format files only. The files in sfiles/ directory are in rmd 
format  and converted from wave format using pvftools. The headers of these 
files are removed so that these can be cut and pasted. In IVRS number of 
messages are generated on the fly, depending on user input. The rmd files 
in sfiles/ directory can be cut or joined to create a new message. For 
example to announce a number 123 to caller, files (from sfiles/ ) "1", 
"hundred", "20", "3" will be added and then played to caller. 
The voice files in this distribution are customized for Rockwell chip 
set modem, which is most popular. The pvftools supports other modem type also 
and files for the other modem can be created using wavtorock script included 
with this distribution.

ADAPTABILITY - This distribution is complete with all the voice files and 
to make a full functional IVRS you need a few line of perl scripts and 
additional message files. You may  need to record messages, if you want 
additional messages or if you do not like the tone of these files. You can 
record all the messages in one file in wav format and cut them in to separate 
files. Then using wavtorock (script included) convert them to rmd files. You 
also need to write small scripts to fetch the numerical data, from data base 
files, which is played to caller. The demo scripts included in this 
distribution gives fair knowledge of module. 

REPORTS - Please send the bug report / suggestions to me, so that those can 
be incorporated in next version. I also would like to know type and make of 
Modem on which it is tested so that I can include list of tested Modems in
future release. I am planning to port this module to NT also provided I get 
sufficient feed back to do so.
